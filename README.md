**SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME**

In the past days, we always witnessed a series of unexpected endings caused by problems that shouldn&#39;t have happened in traditional centralized applications. A variety of human factors resulted in the entire platform disappearing forever, which tortured too many followers and brought them intractable choices. To solve these elements and problems, there must be a distributed application which can neither be shut down nor tampered, and meanwhile it shall be open and transparent. The ETHEREUM PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME, an application jointly innovated and developed by global smart contract developers and based on decentralized network, is just developed in this context. It can neither be shut down nor tampered, and it is open and transparent. Combining smart contracts, it can be executed automatically.

The ETH PRO (abbreviation for ETHEREUM PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME) is the world&#39;s first decentralized lottery game application embedding multiple mechanisms and deployed based on Ethereum network. The ETH PRO was initially designed to create a brand new decentralized smart contract platform that would be fair, equitable and transparent without cheating or tampering, and could be operated sustainably. Those who participate in the ETH PRO only support the world&#39;s second largest cryptocurrency - ETH. The settlement and withdrawal of rewards are also carried out in ETH. The ETH PRO deployed based on Ethereum network creatively combines mechanisms of six protocols and two funds, including the distributed protocol, the redemption protocol, the EPRO protocol, the Bancor protocol, the TOP protocol, the treasure chest protocol, the insurance fund and the ecological development fund. These creative integrating designs truly enable all participated ETHs to be assigned 100% to each community member whose ETH quantity can be enlarged quickly and equitably with the continuous precipitation and accumulation of time. Each community member is able to realize the distributed multiplication of a participated ETH by ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times and even a million times through the ETH PRO distributed application. Meanwhile, with the slow implementation of ETH 2.0, the ETH value will grow over time and the ETH quantity participating in the ETH PRO will realize distributed multiplication. The total value of your ETHs will also grow continuously, and you can finally realize your wealth life of huge digital assets.

The ETH PRO is released on Reddit, an American Ethereum community forum whose website address is [www.reddit.com/r/ethereum](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum). The community forum members are composed of global Ethereum community members. Early evangelists of Ethereum communities, early developers of Ethereum and global enthusiasts of developing smart contracts work together to develop the open source code of the ETH PRO.

The ETH PRO is developed into a decentralized smart contract platform with only global operation and development and no central controllers. Each ETH PRO community member is also the evangelist, the participator, the operator and the developer. Smart contract code related with ETH PRO will be fully open source, which means that smart contracts will automatically execute the triggering of related code once it starts operating. It is because it will constantly operate without interruption as long as the ETH public chain exists. Therefore, we believe that the ETH PRO is the best for you. It is the best ETH lottery game smart contract platform.

With the emergence and continuous growth of the ETH PRO, it is responsible for changing existing deficiencies of various centralized platforms and creating a completely new decentralized integrated ecology. What&#39;s more, it also has responsibility for bringing new possibilities for the development of future decentralized games by innovating the form of digital finance games and changing the fate of people and creating new distributed economic value through the execution of true smart contracts.

**Distribution &amp; Description of ETH PRO Application**

1. Distributed protocol:85%

50% of the distributed protocol is the basis of distributed sub-eth game, combining rewards for distributions, links, nodes and super nodes.

1. Distribution: There is a reward of 2% for contract distribution in 24 hours. It is valid for 3, 000 hours with a peak reward of 2.5 times. Users can click settlement on the page or send relevant instructions through contract to conduct settlement. A settlement shall be carried out for a maximum of 168 hours.
2. Link: For each top nine level addresses, there is a reward of 10% for link distribution. The reward will be increased by one level for linking an address.
3. Node: A reward of 5% of the contract participation will be issued for linking nine addresses. Super node: A reward of 10% of the contract participation will be issued for linking nine nodes.

The peak value for above rewards is 2.5 times with the participation of 1---99 ETHs. The one that reaches the participation peak value of address contracts can participate in through contract again. 50% of the rewards take sub-eths as the basis of overlaying distribution. Sub-eths automatically overlay and participate in distribution when they reach one. Sub-eths can only be calculated and distributed but not withdrawn. Contract and other rewards will not be calculated. The remaining 50% can be used as ETHs to be withdrawn. The calculated value of link distribution is the numerical value of ETHs to be withdrawn.

1. Redemption protocol: The peak value of redemption within 24 hours is 1% of a contract address. After applying for redemption, the address can no longer participate in, and not any reward will be calculated. Redemption value = total address participation \* 0.8 Ôºç total distribution.

1. EPRO protocol: 5% (2.5% of benefit-sharing of pledge + 2.5% of Bancor protocol)

How to get EPROs: EPROs are produced 100% through the EPRO protocol, adopting ETH inflow mechanism and dual EPRO destruction mechanism. One EPRO will be produced when the address contract and direct link contract participation reaches nine. EPROs can be used to ETH benefit-sharing of pledge, Bancor trading ETH and the ecological circulation application of the ETH PRO.

a. Bancor protocol:2.5%. Smartly conduct EPRO/ETH trading through the Bancor protocol, and 10% of ETHs will be charged for the trading. The ETH trading fee charged will 100% go to the distributed protocol pool to create stable source of earnings.

b. Pledge ETH-sharing: 2.5%. Share ETHs by pledging EPRO. Equally share ETH based on pledge quantity. 10% of ETHs in the pledge pool will be shared within 24 hours. The pledge is redeemable. 90% of the pledge can be redeemed, and 10% of that will be destroyed. 10% of EORO transfer transactions between addresses will also be destroyed.

1. TOP protocol: 3%

The cycle of the TOP protocol is 24 hours. Rewards will be given to TOP 3 of the participation value of the link addresses within the cycle.

1. 30% of 3% of the TOP reward pool in current cycle will be distributed as rewards to TOP 3. The remaining 70% will be distributed as rewards to the ones in next cycle, et cetera. The reward percentages issued to TOP 3 are respectively 60%, 30% and 10%.

1. Treasure chest protocol: 2%

1. Time treasure chest opens for 72-hour countdown. Three hours will be added for each address participation with a peak value of 72 hours.
2. When countdown timer ticks down to 0, the late participated 556 addresses will share the grand reward in the treasure chest protocol pool. The last address will get 25% of the reward. The one before the last one to the sixth address from the last will be distributed 25% of the reward equally. The 7th to the 56th address from the last will get 25% of the reward equally, and the 57th to the 556th addresses from the last will also get 25% of the reward equally.

1. Insurance fund: 1%

The insurance protocol can only enable the insurance fund within 48 hours when the calculation of the treasure chest protocol is completed and meanwhile satisfying the condition that the quantity of distributed protocol pool is insufficient.

a. After enabling the insurance protocol, distributed game link relationship will be kept, and the distribution data will be initialized. After their completion, the contract value of the insurance protocol will be 100% sent to the contract pool of the distributed protocol automatically.

6. Ecological development fund: 4%

4% of the participation of a contract address will be rewarded to the entire ETH PRO ecological development fund to global contributors participating in developing the ETH PRO, the entire ETH PRO ecological application operation development and GAS expense.

ETH PRO&#39;s unique multiple protocols and fund mechanisms are interconnected and mutually balanced and co-promote the booming development of the ETH PRO. The distributed protocol enables your ETH quantity to increase constantly through distributed digital logic games. The redemption protocol realizes your free entry and exit of ETH and gives you every chance to fully experience the charm of true smart contracts. The EPRO protocol can make your participation and links more valuable as well as synchronously drive price up. The Bancor protocol can increase distributed game operation cycle, produce good profit for the ETH PRO and participate in circularly. The TOP protocol brings great returns for those who truly contribute to the its development. The treasure chest protocol realizes equal rights of each user and enables the last participated 556 addresses to win the treasure chest. The insurance fund can realize the sustainable growth of the ETH PRO and feedback adequate ETHs to community members who participate in its development at the first time. The ecological development fund can let more and more developers of smart contracts in the world participate in the R&amp;D and deployment of global ecology of the ETH PRO and promote the diverse, continuous booming development of the ETH PRO. All these protocols and funds work together to make the ETH PRO become not only the most popular application in the Ethereum network but also the phenomenal application in the whole decentralized network.

ETH PRO&#39;s future belongs to the entire network. ETH PRO&#39;s digital fortune is distributed throughout the whole community. Let&#39;s woke together with global community hobbyists to make the ETH PRO become a phenomenal application and realize our digital fortune future.
